      <h2>About me and this site</h2>
      <p>This website was created to introduce you to the unfamiliar but incredibly fun world of Cyphers. Growing up in Korea, I was a passionate Cyphers player, which is why I applied to Seneca's CPP program. I created this site to share my love for Cyphers through this assessment. I hope you enjoy the information and reviews on this site.</p>
      <p>I declare that my assessment is wholly my own work in accordance with Seneca Academic Policy. No part of this assessment has been copied manually or electronically from any other source (including web sites) except for the information supplied by the WEB222 instructors and / or made available in this assessment for my use. I also declare that no part of this assignment has been distributed to other students.</p>
